## Intro and Objectives 

The goal of this project is to build a database from several 'dirty' CSV files. I was given six 'dirty' CSV files with no further context. The objective was to create a MySQL database for a VHS rental store that is already operational, i.e., with existing operational data. To achieve this, I cleaned all the files, structured them according to their interrelations, and loaded them into a MySQL database.


## Output 

The output of this project is stored in this repository, as follows: 

- **data:** Both the raw CSV data provided and the cleaned CSV tables 
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks with a step-by-step cleaning process of each CSV file
- **sql:** Script for the final MySQL database
